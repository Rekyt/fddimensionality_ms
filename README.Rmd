```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("Rekyt/fddimensionality_ms")
```


### How to run

The analyses of the compendium heavily rely on the use the of workflow management package [`drake`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=drake). All analyses are contained within the `R` directory.

To run them run the following lines:

# Beware this may take a long time (>10 hours)
pkgload::load_all()
drake::make(global_workflow())
```
